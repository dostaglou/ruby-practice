# Create a class called Bird
# An instance of a bird will need to have a name, origin, age, and nickname which defaults to the Name
# The four values above should be initialized with keyword aguments, not positional arguments
# The Bird class will need to have a variable reader for all four above values
# The Bird class will need to have a variable writer for Nickname as nicknames are always changing
# The Bird class will need to have a method called `increment_age` which will take no variables but add 1 to the age
