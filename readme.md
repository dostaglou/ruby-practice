# Ruby Practice

This is a repository with the sole intent of teaching basic ruby to individuals with some coding background but no background in ruby itself. It is structured into short lessons, each with their own concepts and tests. Each lesson builds on the previous to help provide greater breadth and dept to the learner. The compactness of the lessons plus pre-made tests should allow simple self study or facilitate directed study. By the end, the learner should feel empowered to write their own ruby scripts and tackle learning larger ruby frame-works like Rails with confidence and competence.
